## difference between git and other vcs

- Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, with each user having a full copy of the repository. It supports branching and merging efficiently.

- Other VCS types, like SVN or CVS, are centralized systems where the repository is stored on a central server, and developers check out and commit changes to that single location.

## git push and git commit uses

**`git commit`** saves changes to your local repository, recording a snapshot of the current state of your files.

**`git push`** uploads your local commits to a remote repository, making them available to others.

## concept of git repository

**remote repository** is a version of your project hosted on a server, typically on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. It allows multiple developers to collaborate by pushing their local changes to the remote, and pulling others' changes from it, ensuring a shared and synchronized codebase.

## uses of git fork

**Fork** is a Git operation where you create a personal copy of someone else's repository, typically on platforms like GitHub. This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

**Usage**:

1. Fork a repository to make a personal copy of it.
2. Clone the fork to your local machine for development.
3. After making changes, push them back to your fork.
4. Create a **pull request** to suggest changes from your fork to the original repository.
